<h3>Saltibarsciai - What is that?</h3>
<p class="info">
    This refreshing, cold beetroot soup is a part of traditional Lithuanian cuisine. It consists of a creamy blend of pickled or boiled 
    beetroots and tangy kefir or buttermilk, poured over grated cucumbers and hard-boiled eggs. The whole soup is generously seasoned with dill, 
    and usually left to set until all the flavors are thoroughly combined.
    <br>
    It is usually prepared in the summertime, and is best served chilled, preferably with potatoes on the side. 
    It can be enjoyed as an appetizer or a light main course.

</ol>

<h3>Tip</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        If you like saltibarsciai with a milder taste, you can make it with boiled beets - cut them
         into straws. In this case, you can add a splash of apple cider vinegar to the frosting.</li>
